        <p> My name is Yevheniia, I was born in Ukraine. In big city Kiev.
            I came to United States in 2016, right now I live
            in Cary North Carolina. I love this place and probably will stay here forever. I have a little daughter and 
            loving husband. I dont have much codding background,
            but I was studying HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and SQL at CodeAcademy website.
            It was great source for me. 
            As I said originally from Ukraine, I was working as daycare teacher, also attended to University where
            was studying program engineering for two years, 
            I have had to quit my University since were prepearing
            to move to United States.
            Also I really love animals, my favorites are reptiles. I have amazing bearded dragon, and had Veiled Chameleons in the past.
            I can spend a lot of time with them.
